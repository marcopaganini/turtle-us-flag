# turtle-us-flag
A correctly rendered US flag using python's turtle module (for repl.it)

This is a simple program to draw the US flag using Python's turtle module (turtle graphics for Python). I wrote this back in 2011 as a request from my son for a "really complicated Python Turtle program". This repo contains the [repl.it](repl.it) modified version of the original program.
